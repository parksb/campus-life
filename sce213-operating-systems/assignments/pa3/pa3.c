 *   You can assume that all pages are writable; this means, when a page fault
 *   happens with valid PTE without writable permission, it was set for the
 *   copy-on-write.
 *
 * RETURN
 *   @true on successful fault handling

 * DESCRIPTION

 *   The @current process at the moment should be put to the **TAIL** of the
 *   @processes list, and @current should be replaced to the requested process.
 *   Make sure that the next process is unlinked from the @processes.
 *   If there is no process with @pid in the @processes list, fork a process
 *   from the @current. This implies the forked child process should have
 *   the identical page table entry 'values' to its parent's (i.e., @current)
 *   page table. Also, should update the writable bit properly to implement
 *   the copy-on-write feature.
